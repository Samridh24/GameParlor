🐍 Snakes and Ladders

🏏 Hand Cricket

📌 Features
Interactive menu-driven interface

Multiplayer mode support (local two-player)

Uses system commands, color-coded outputs (ANSI codes), and randomization

Educational value: Demonstrates handling of functions, loops, conditionals, 2D arrays, and more in C

Easily extendable game structure
